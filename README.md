# Practical Work II

## Description of the work
This project is a personal multi-page website built with HTML and CSS.
It showcases my learning progress and presents information about me, my degree program, a chosen topic, partner links, and a contact form.

### Website sections
- Home (index.html)
- About (public/about.html)
- Topic (public/topic.html)
- Net (public/net.html)
- Degree (public/degree.html)
- FCE (public/fce.html)
- Contact (public/contact.html)

## Project structure
- index.html (root)
- public/ (all internal pages)
- css/ (shared stylesheet)
- images/ (all images)
- README.md (documentation)
- LICENSE
- .gitignore

## Problems during development
- Managing relative paths between root and `public/`.
- Keeping consistent navigation across pages.
- Making the layout responsive without frameworks.

## Conclusions
This project improved my ability to structure multi-page sites, write semantic HTML, create a shared CSS stylesheet, and deploy using GitHub Pages.
